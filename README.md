# Mauritius-Australia Flights Dashboard
## Description

The problem:  I was planning my return to Australia and was looking for the best flights that would match my flight preferences. Given that I had a flexible 1-month window and two options as destinations, there was a high volume of data to collect, analyse and track.

Solution: I built a web scrapper that performed searches on both destinations daily. The data was extracted, compiled and fed into a dashboard to display key information such as pricing trends and flight availability.

## Process Overview

Here is an overview of the steps taken:

(1)	Web scraping - FL00 & FL01 are the web scraping scripts for Brisbane and Sydney respectively. The scripts were scheduled to run daily, scrapping flights data from a popular travel platform for departure dates between 15/02/2020 and 17/03/2020.  Once extracted, the data was compiled in a dataframe (table like data structure) and exported to csv files.

(2)	Compiling and preparing data – The FL02 script compiled all downloaded data (including previous days’ searches) into a single table. This script also performed data wrangling tasks (transforming and cleansing data) to prepare the data for visualisation purposes and analytics. 

(3)	Dashboard – The FL03A script builds an interactive dashboard, using the data generated by step 2 to generate the visualisations and table as shown in the demo.
