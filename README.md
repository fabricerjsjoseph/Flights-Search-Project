# Mauritius-Australia Flights Dashboard
## Description

I was planning my return to Australia and wanted to analyse the flights data available for a flexible 1-month window and two options as destinations.

Therefore, I built a web scrapper that could perform searches on both destinations daily and export the results in csv files.
I built a dashboard so I could analyse the data to analyse prices, trends, itineraries to find the best combinations that match my preferences.
